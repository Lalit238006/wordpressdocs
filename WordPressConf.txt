XAMPP is a completely free, easy to install Apache distribution containing MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. The XAMPP open source package has been set up to be incredibly easy to install and to use.

Step 4: Rename the extracted folder with 	name: MyFirstWebsite.

Q: Why we need to extract Word-press(Zip file) in htdocs.
A: htdocs stands for “HyperTextDocumentS”. if you have a folder or directory in your computer server which is called htdocs. this is the directory where you put your public files call root directory. So lets say i have a htdocs directory in my computer, so i put a file called webune.html in the htdocs folder, i can access that file by going to my website. 
	example: http://www.example.com/webune.html 

Q: can we change root folder?
A: Yes! but we have to do certain configuration in server's file.
